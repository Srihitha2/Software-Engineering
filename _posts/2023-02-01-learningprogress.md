Here is the link to downlolad [java latest version 19.0.2](https://javadl.oracle.com/webapps/download/AutoDL?BundleId=247947_0ae14417abb444ebb02b9815e2103550) for windows.
After java I have installed JDK(Java Development Kit) which is used to develop java applications and JRE(Java Runtime Environment) for executing java programs. I used Visual Studio Code to execute all my practice codes. To use VSCode for java development, I have installed some extensions, such as Java Extension Pack, which provides java language features and debugging.

Here are my [helloworld](https://github.com/Srihitha2/Software-Engineering/blob/main/codes/helloworld.java) and [addition](https://github.com/Srihitha2/Software-Engineering/blob/main/codes/Addition.java) programs.
