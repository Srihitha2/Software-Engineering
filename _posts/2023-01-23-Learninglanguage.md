I want to learn JAVA for this semester. As I am from Electronics background in my bachelors, I am familiar with C,C++ and also Python which i have learnt out of my interest. I wanted to learn Java as it is an object oriented programming language and because of its wide range of applications. I am hoping for a career that assures security and growth for my expanding skill sets and I have applied to few summer internships where most of the companies are looking for programmers who are efficient in java. So, this will be an opportunity for me to enhance my skillset and grow in my career.
