In the fourth week of my preparation, I have started with learning Strings and Arrays. In Java, a string is an object that represents a sequence of characters. Strings are commonly used to represent and handle textual data, such as names, addresses, messages, and any other kind of information that can be expressed as a sequence of characters and are represented by the "String" class. Strings are "immutable", which means that once a string object is created, its value cannot be changed. If we want to modify a string then modifying will not actually change the original string, but instead create a new string object with that modified value.
Syntax: <String_Type> <string_variable> = "<sequence_of_string>"; For example, String str = "Hello World!"; This creates a new string object with the value "Hello World!" and assigns it to the variable str.
