For this week of my preparation, I have continued practicing codes on strings and started with String comparision methods. String comparison methods are used to compare two strings and determine whether they are equal or not.
1. By Using equals() Method: This method compares two strings for equality. It returns true if the strings are equal, and false otherwise. [StringEquals()](https://github.com/Srihitha2/Software-Engineering/blob/main/codes/Stringequals.java). Here it returns output as The two strings are not equal. [Example](https://github.com/Srihitha2/Software-Engineering/blob/main/codes/StringEquals().java)
2. By Using == operator: In Java, the == operator is used to compare two objects to see if they are the same object in memory. When comparing strings using the == operator, it checks whether the two string variables refer to the same object in memory, rather than comparing the contents of the strings. It compaers references not values. [String==operator](https://github.com/Srihitha2/Software-Engineering/blob/main/codes/Stringcomparision.java)
3. By Using compareTo(): In Java, the compareTo() method is used to compare two strings lexicographically. If the two strings are equal, the method returns 0. If the first string is lexicographically less than the second string, the method returns a negative integer. If the first string is lexicographically greater than the second string, the method returns a positive integer.

Java Inheritance: Inheritance is one of the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming in Java. It is a mechanism that enables one class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. The class that is being inherited from is known as the superclass or parent class, and the class that inherits these properties and behaviors is known as the subclass or child class.
To create a subclass, the extends keyword is used in the class declaration, followed by the name of the parent class. The subclass inherits all of the public and protected properties and behaviors of the parent class, and can also have its own properties and behaviors.
Syntax: class Subclass-name extends Superclass-name  
{  
   //methods and fields  
}  
The extends keyword indicates that you are making a new class that derives from an existing class. The meaning of "extends" is to increase the functionality.

Challenges: I have practiced many codes from all the topics discussed from beginning of the learning process and the main challenges I faced were Java has a vast collection of libraries and frameworks that are difficult to navigate to. For now, Learning how to use these tools effectively requires more time and practice.
