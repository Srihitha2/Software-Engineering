For the second week of my preparation I have started with learning packages and importing required packages for the program. Packages prevent from naming conflicts.  For example, import java.util.* is a built-in package that contains various utility classes and interfaces. A java package is a group of similar types of classes, interfaces and sub-packages. There are two types called built-in and user-defined packages. Some examples of built-in are lang,util,io,sql etc., Also, I have learnt all the selection statements and their syntaxes such as
1. if--->"if" statement is used to evaluate a condition i.e if a certain condition is true then a block of statements is executed otherwise not.In other words, it is used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is met.
if(condition) 
{
   // Statements to execute if
   // condition is true
}
2. if-else--->If "if" condition is false then it executes the else block i.e,it is used to execute one block of code if a condition is met, and another block if it's not.
if (condition)
{
    // Executes this block if
    // condition is true
}
else
{
    // Executes this block if
    // condition is false
}
3. nested-if---> if statement can contain a if or if-else statement inside another if or else-if statement i.e an if statement inside an if statement.
if (condition1) 
{
   // Executes when condition1 is true
   if (condition2) 
   {
      // Executes when condition2 is true
   }
}
4. if-else-if--->it contains the if-statement followed by multiple else-if statements. In this, there can be as many as ‘else-if’ blocks associated with one ‘if’ block but only one ‘else’ block is allowed with one ‘if’ block. We can also define an else statement at the end of the chain.
if (condition)
    statement;
else if (condition)
    statement;
.
.
else
    statement;
5. switch-case--->it contains multiple blocks of code and each case is executed based on variable being switched.It provides a convenient method for directing the execution to various sections of the code based on the result of the expression. 
Python does not provide a switch case statement. So I felt this a bit tricky and need to be explored more. 
switch (expression)
{
  case value1:
    statement1;
    break;
  case value2:
    statement2;
    break;
  .
  .
  case valueN:
    statementN;
    break;
  default:
    statementDefault;
}
6. break--->Break is used to exit from a loop.
I have also covered some of the loops in java like while, do-while and for loop. A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. for loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times and contains four parts like initialization,condition,increment/decrement and statements.

7. for loop: is used to execute a block of code multiple times, until a certain condition is met.
8. while loop: Used to execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.
9. do-while loop: Similar to the while loop, but the block of code is executed at least once.

Summary:
In Java, control statements and looping constructs are used to control the flow of a program's execution. Each of these constructs is used to execute a block of code based on certain conditions or to repeat a specific action multiple times.
