For this week of preparation I have started learning from Jump statements like continue, break and return and practised some codes. We have already learnt about the break statement in my earlier week progress report.
It was used to "jump out" of a switch statement. The break statement can also be used to jump out of a loop. [Break](https://github.com/Srihitha2/Software-Engineering/blob/main/codes/Break.java). Here in this example the loop stops when i equals to 4 and output is 0 1 2 3.
Using break statement in switch: [Break_2](https://github.com/Srihitha2/Software-Engineering/blob/main/codes/Break_2.java)
Continue: The "continue" statement is used within a loop to skip the current iteration and move on to the next iteration if a specific condition is met. When the continue statement is encountered within a loop, the remaining statements in the current iteration are skipped and the loop continues with the next iteration.
