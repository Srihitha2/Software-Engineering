For this week of my preparation, I have continued practicing codes on strings and started with String comparision methods. String comparison methods are used to compare two strings and determine whether they are equal or not.
1. By Using equals() Method: This method compares two strings for equality. It returns true if the strings are equal, and false otherwise. [StringEquals()](https://github.com/Srihitha2/Software-Engineering/blob/main/codes/Stringequals.java). Here it returns output as The two strings are not equal. [Example](https://github.com/Srihitha2/Software-Engineering/blob/main/codes/StringEquals().java)
2. By Using == operator: In Java, the == operator is used to compare two objects to see if they are the same object in memory. When comparing strings using the == operator, it checks whether the two string variables refer to the same object in memory, rather than comparing the contents of the strings. It compaers references not values. [String==operator](https://github.com/Srihitha2/Software-Engineering/blob/main/codes/Stringcomparision.java)
