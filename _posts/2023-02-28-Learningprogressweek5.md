For this week of my preparation, I have continued practicing codes on strings and started with String comparision methods. String comparison methods are used to compare two strings and determine whether they are equal or not.
1. By Using equals() Method: This method compares two strings for equality. It returns true if the strings are equal, and false otherwise.
