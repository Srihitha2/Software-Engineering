For this week of my preparation, I have continued my learning with java inheritance, polymorphism and practiced some codes related to control statements.
Here is the example code for java inheritance.[VehicleInheritance](https://github.com/Srihitha2/Software-Engineering/blob/main/codes/InheritanceExample.java)
In this code it defines a Vehicle class with a start() and stop() method and a Car class which inherits from Vehicle. The Car class has an additional honk() method and a numDoors. The Main class creates an instance of Car and calls methods from both the Vehicle and Car classes.
#The output of the above code is:
Make: Toyota
Model: Camry
Year: 2021
The vehicle is starting.
The vehicle is stopping.
Number of doors: 4
The car is honking.
